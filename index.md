# Welcome to the Autonomous Vehicles Software System Tutorial

This comprehensive tutorial series is designed for autonomous vehicle enthusiasts, engineers, and researchers who want to understand the software systems that power self-driving cars. We'll start with the fundamental building blocks and gradually move to more complex topics.

## Tutorial Series Overview

### 1. Sensor Stack (Current)
- Understanding sensor data preprocessing
- Kalman Filter implementation
- Error State Kalman Filter (ESKF)

### 2. Coming Soon
- Perception systems
- Localization and mapping
- Planning and control
- System integration

## Getting Started

The first tutorial focuses on the sensor stack, which is the foundation of any autonomous vehicle system. You'll learn about:
